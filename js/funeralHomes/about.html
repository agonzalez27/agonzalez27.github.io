<h1>MARIGOLD.Life</h1>

<p>In Pre-Hispanic Mexico, natives believed that Marigolds'bright colors would guide their deceased loved ones to their respective altars during the day of the dead.  The tradition has continued until today in many parts of Mexico and has expanded around the world.

Unfortunately, most of us are unfamiliar with the process of making funeral arrangements for a loved one.  Common questions include: Who are the funeral providers in my city?  How much will it cost?  Should we do a cremation or traidional burial?
<br>
<br>
Through MARIGOLD.Life, you can find information that will assist you in making critical decisions in a short period of time.  Funeral planning is stressful but hopefully with MARIGOLD.Life, things will become a bit easier.
